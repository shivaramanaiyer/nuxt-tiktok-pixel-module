# nuxt-tiktok-pixel-module

> A NuxtJS module thats injects Tiktok Pixel code highly inspired by [nuxt-facebook-pixel-module](https://github.com/WilliamDASILVA/nuxt-facebook-pixel-module).

Functions very similar to the nuxt-facebook-pixel-module. Please refer there for general behaviour. Will add other features over time.
